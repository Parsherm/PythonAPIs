# PythonAPIs
A practice for getting used to communicating with APIs in Python

There will be multiple different projects that I will be putting in here to get a diverse 
amount of practice with different APIs. 

# 1. stock_visualizer.py
- This is a simple project that uses yfinance in python to get stock price data for tech
  that are in the S&P500. There is also a simple, crude interface to use use the program
  visualize the data.
